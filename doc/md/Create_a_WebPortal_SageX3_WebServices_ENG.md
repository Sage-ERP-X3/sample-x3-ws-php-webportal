Using Sage X3 web services

Update 10

15 06 16

The purpose of this document is to explain how to invoke SOAP X3 Web services from a web portal in PHP.

The portal gives you access to your data in Sage X3 such as orders or customer information in real-time. You do not need to share large files across networks or via email. Because the data stays in X3, not saved out to an external server, it is more secure. Remote employees like sales professions can not only view data, but they can also create new data such as sales orders from any computer with internet access via a browser.

You can create the portal using Sage X3 SOAP web services functionality and WampServerÂ® is a Windows web development environment that allows you to create web applications with Apache2, PHP, and a MySQL database. In addition, PhpMyAdmin allows you to easily manage your databases. \[Source: wampserver.com\].

Audience

This document is intended for experienced Sage X3 users with administrator level permissions who may or may not have prior experience with publishing web services. There is also a section specifically for developers who have advanced coding and web services knowledge.

From [*https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)

<span id="_Toc453744990" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc449016740" class="anchor"></span></span>Build the portal

<span id="_Toc453676512" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453744991" class="anchor"></span></span>Install and configure WampServer

You can download WampServer from *[www.wampserver.com](http://www.wampserver.com).* On the homepage, scroll down and download this one:

**WAMP SERVER (64 BITS & PHP 5.5) 2.5 **

By default, WampServer installs to **c:\\sage\\wamp**, but you can select a different folder when prompted.

Next, you need to choose a default browser such as Chrome or IE.

Navigate to the EXE file on your computer.

Select the file and click Open.

Examples for IE and Chrome are shown below.

<img src="./media/image8.png" width="592" height="156" />

<img src="./media/image9.png" width="592" height="149" />

You need to change the default http port, which is **80**. You can, for example, change it to **8125**, or to another port.

<img src="./media/image10.png" width="445" height="323" />

Navigate to **c:\\Sage\\wamp\\bin\\apache2.4.9\\conf\\**

In Notepad ++, open **httpd.conf** and edit the file as follows:

\#

\# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or

\# ports, instead of the default. See also the &lt;VirtualHost&gt;

\# directive.

\#

\# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to

\# prevent Apache from seizing all bound IP addresses.

\#

\#Listen 12.34.56.78:80

Listen \[::0\]:8125

Save this file and restart all services for WampServer.

Right-click the WampServer icon on your desktop or taskbar, and select **Restart All Services**.

**Note**: You can use this same menu to start and stop all services for WampServer at any time.

Leave **All Services Running** while you set up the portal.

<img src="./media/image13.png" width="280" height="149" />

<span id="_Toc453676514" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453744993" class="anchor"></span></span>Install and configure the PHP Web portal

If you have not already done so, start the web service pool you just created. See steps in the previous section for details.

<span id="_Toc453676515" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453744994" class="anchor"></span></span>Download the PHP web portal project files

The project file for the PHP web portal is available from GitHub. The project file is open to everyone, so you do not need a GitHub account. The download file contains everything you need to create and configure the portal including the X3 patch for the YOSOH web service.

From GitHub [*https://github.com/Sage-ERP-X3/sample-x3-ws-php-webportal*](https://github.com/Sage-ERP-X3/sample-x3-ws-php-webportal), click **Download**.

If you are logged in to GitHub, you have the option to Clone or download.

Be sure to download the ZIP file.

<img src="./media/image14.png" width="547" height="216" />

Save the **sample-x3-ws-php-webportal-master.zip** file to **C:\\Sage\\wamp\\www**.

<img src="./media/image15.png" width="549" height="141" />

Extract all files to **C:\\Sage\\wamp\\www\\sagex3**.

<img src="./media/image16.png" width="544" height="373" />

<span id="_Toc449016746" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453676516" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453744995" class="anchor"></span></span></span>Configure the portal

Next, you need to configure the portal to communicate with Sage X3.

In the folder **C:\\Sage\\wamp\\www\\sagex3\\config**, open the **Config.php** file.

The following fields should match what you entered when you configured your web service pool in X3:

WSDL Your X3 server URL

CODE\_LANG

POOL\_ALIAS

> WS\_ORDER YOSOH for orders, is just for this example. You might set up a different web service.
>
> WEB\_SITE\_LOGIN and WEB\_SITE\_PASSWD represent the credentials you will share with those who will be accessing these web services via the web portal.

&lt;?php

class Config {

public static $WSDL = "...";

public static $CODE\_LANG = "ENG";

public static $CODE\_USER = "...";

public static $PASSWORD = "...";

public static $POOL\_ALIAS = "SEED";

public static $REQUEST\_CONFIG = "adxwss.optreturn=XML";

public static $WS\_ORDER = "YOSOH";

public static $WEB\_SITE\_LOGIN = "...";

public static $WEB\_SITE\_PASSWD = "...";

}

?&gt;

Do not change the punctuation and formatting.

From the WampServer menu**, Restart All Services.**

Enter the URL for your portal in your default browser. In this example the URL is *<http://x3pu9trainvm:8125/sagex3/>*

This is the name of X3 Syracuse server and the number was configured in **httpd.conf**.

This is an example of what your portal could look like.

<span id="install_patch_x3" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453676517" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453744996" class="anchor"></span></span></span>Install the X3 patch

You need to install the X3 patch containing the YOSOH web services. The file was downloaded in the ZIP file from GitHub.

The name of file is **SRC\_SVG\_WEB\_PHP\_YYYYMMDD\_NN.dat** and it is located in the following directory: C:\\Sage\\wamp\\www\\X3\\PATCH\_X3.

<img src="./media/image18.png" width="512" height="161" />

**Important! You can only install the patch to the SEED folder, not to the X3 folder.**

The patch contains the following X3 objects:

|          |                        |                                                                   |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type** | **Objects**            | **Comments**                                                      |

The web service âAvailable stockâ is not yet used at this moment.

<span id="_Toc453676518" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453744997" class="anchor"></span></span>Publish the web service

After installing the patch with the web service, you need to publish the service. This validates the web service so that it is visible.

In X3, navigate to Development &gt; Script dictionary &gt; Scripts and open **Web services** (GESAWE).

<img src="./media/image19.png" width="579" height="290" />Click **Global publication**.

<span id="_Toc453744998" class="anchor"></span>Use the portal

Now that the web service has been published, you can begin accessing Sage X3 data in real-time via the portal.

WampServer needs to be running to access the portal and Sage X3 services.

<span id="_Toc453676519" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453744999" class="anchor"></span></span>Access the portal

Using the default browser you set earlier, enter the URL for your web portal.

For this example, the URL is http://x3pu9trainvm:8125/sagex3.

Click **CONNECTION** and log in with the username and password you set up when configured the portal.

**Note**: It is not required to be logged in to the portal to view orders.

Remember, because this web service is based on YOSOH for sales information, this portal provides access to orders in Sage X3.

From the **ORDERS X3** pull-down menu, select **LIST OF ORDERS**.

<img src="./media/image20.png" width="471" height="60" />

<img src="./media/image21.png" width="472" height="188" />

You can now see a list of current orders in your Sage X3 instance.

<img src="./media/image22.png" width="515" height="183" />

When you look at this data in Sage X3, you can see that it is the same.

<img src="./media/image23.png" width="471" height="167" />

<span id="_Toc453676520" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453745000" class="anchor"></span></span>Read an order

You can read orders by selecting from the list or by selecting **READ AN ORDER** from the **ORDERS X3** menu and entering the order number. For either method, you do not need to be logged in to the portal.

Click the order number for one of the orders in the list. This example uses order SOWFR0120004.

Clicking the order number or enter the order number provides detailed information about that order.

<img src="./media/image24.png" width="471" height="269" />

<span id="_Toc453676521" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453745001" class="anchor"></span></span>Create an order

You can create an order in X3 using the portal. You need to be logged in to the portal to do this.

<img src="./media/image25.png" width="471" height="76" />

Remember, you defined the login and password for your portal in Config.php.

Open the file Config.php

need to connect to create an order; donât need to login to view orders

&lt;?php

class Config {

â¦

public static $WEB\_SITE\_LOGIN = "websage";

public static $WEB\_SITE\_PASSWD = "websage";

}

?&gt;

<span id="_Toc453676522" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc453745002" class="anchor"></span></span>Create an order

In addition to viewing orders, you can create a new order through the portal.

**Note**: To create a new order, you need to be logged in to the portal.

From the **ORDERS X3** pull-down menu, select **CREATE AN ORDER**.

Enter the relevant information as you would if you were working directly in Sage X3 and click **Submit**.

<img src="./media/image26.png" width="471" height="353" />

When the order has been created, click the oder number to view details.

<img src="./media/image27.png" width="471" height="284" />

In Sage X3 entry transaction WS, you can see the same order.

<img src="./media/image28.png" width="471" height="241" />

<span id="_Toc453745003" class="anchor"></span>For developers

This section provides details specifically for developers who have advanced coding and web services knowledge. It uses the same YOSOH web service as an example.

This describes how to initiate these calls without the external application, but instead with the X3 test tool. It also shows the PHP or C\# codes that call the same X3 web services.

This web service is an object web service with the optimized transaction WS.
